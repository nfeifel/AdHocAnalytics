# pomp_tweets

[Anthony Pompliao (aka "Pomp")](https://twitter.com/APompliano) is a heavy Twitter user whose account is largely focused on the subject matters bitcoin and blockchain. As a follower of his, I noticed that the focus of his tweets had shifted over time to be less about securitized tradional assets and maore about bitcoin itself. I validated this through pulling Twitter data in R, and [tweeted my observation at him](https://twitter.com/n_feifel/status/1125164722364538881). Here's his [response](https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1125171264518275072).
