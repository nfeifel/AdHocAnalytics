# Analytics
This is where I store code and arrtifacts of personal analytics projects I have done. Most projects involve me gathering data (eg from APIs, webs scraping, flat files), performing transformations on that data, and turning into an analysis that - at least I - found interesting. Tools and languages used throughout this repo include python, SQL, R, and jupyter notebooks.
