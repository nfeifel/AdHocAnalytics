# Strava Workouts

Some of my family members and I decided to run 366 miles in 2020, equating to one mile per day for the whole year. We are using Strava to track our progress and share our results with each other. One of the great things about Strava is their REST API functionality, which lets you pull tons of data on your workouts.

I wanted to make sure I was staying on par with my goal for the year, so I decided to pull my account data and analyze it. If you're a Strava user and want to be able to do something similar, I hope this can be resourceful.

If you haven't already set up API access for your account, you can follow Strava's instructions [here](https://developers.strava.com/docs/getting-started/).
