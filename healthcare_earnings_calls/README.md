# healthcare_earnings_calls

One of our core beliefs at Ro is that a telehealth will rise to become a dominant form of healthcare in the near future. Our company website states "We believe that in 10 years, more healthcare services will be provided online or at home than in a doctor's office or pharmacy." It looks like largest public healthcare companies are starting to agree.

Every quarter, public companies are required to hold an earnings call where company leaders speak to their companies' performance as well as the larger business environment. With Covid-19 upending much of our world, and healthcare being a central theme, I decided to analyze the earnings calls of healthcare companies in the S&P 500, a list comprising the largest public companies in the world, to see if anything stood out. My finding? A noticeable change change in language that indicates a broad shift towards telehealth.

This code is the work behind [this Medium post](LINK), where I write up my findings.
